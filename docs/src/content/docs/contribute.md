description: How the envx repository is organized and how to work in it.
---

envx is a task-driven monorepo. The Go CLI lives in `app/` and this documentation
site lives in `docs/`. All common workflows run through
[Task](https://taskfile.dev/).

## Common tasks

```sh
task --list          # list every task

# CLI (app/)
task envx:run -- --help
task envx:test       # run tests with race detector and coverage
task envx:check      # format, lint, and vulnerability scan
task envx:build      # build the binary

# Docs (docs/)
task docs:dev        # start the docs dev server
task docs:check      # lint, format, and type-check the docs
task docs:build      # build the static site
```

## Application internals

The CLI's architecture, directory layout, package dependencies, and the exact
steps for adding or changing a setting are documented in the
[application internals guide](https://github.com/go-envx/envx/blob/main/app/README.md).

## Conventions

- Prefer `task` over raw commands; check `task --list` first.
- `check` tasks auto-format, then lint. Run the relevant `check` before opening a
  pull request.
- Pull request titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, …); CI validates the title.
