The envx CLI is a small set of commands for resolving, inspecting, and running
your projects' environments. Each command has its own page with examples and its
full flag list.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`create`](/commands/create/) | Scaffold a ready-to-run example workspace. |
| [`get`](/commands/get/) | Resolve a project's environment and print one value. |
| [`run`](/commands/run/) | Run a command with the merged environment injected. |
| [`set`](/commands/set/) | Write a key/value into a namespace's overlay file. |
| [`explain`](/commands/explain/) | Show each resolved value and the file it came from. |
| [`diff`](/commands/diff/) | Compare a project's environment across two environments. |

## Global flags

These flags are available on every command:

| Flag | Environment variable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--config` | `ENVX_CONFIG` | Path to `envx.yaml`. Overrides auto-discovery. |
| `--help`, `-h` | | Show help for the command. |
| `--version` | | Print the envx version (root command). |

## Command flags

Beyond the global flags, most commands share a common set. The flags in the top
group map to [settings](/configuration/schema/#settings-2) and override the
matching value in `envx.yaml`; the bottom group is available only at the command
line. A ✓ marks where each flag applies:

| Flag | [`get`](/commands/get/) | [`run`](/commands/run/) | [`set`](/commands/set/) | [`explain`](/commands/explain/) | [`diff`](/commands/diff/) |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Configurable in `envx.yaml`** | | | | | |
| [`--env`](/configuration/schema/#env), `-E` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| [`--require-overlays`](/configuration/schema/#require_overlays) | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| [`--prefix`](/configuration/schema/#prefix) | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| [`--suffix`](/configuration/schema/#suffix) | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| [`--delimiter`](/configuration/schema/#delimiter) | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| [`--namespace-prefix`](/configuration/schema/#namespace_prefix) | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
| [`--overload`](/configuration/schema/#overload) | | ✓ | | | |
| **Command-line only** | | | | | |
| `--reveal` | | | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `--output`, `-o` | | | | ✓ | ✓ |

`diff` compares two environments given as positional arguments, so it does not
accept `--env`. `create` is not shown: it scaffolds a workspace and takes only
`--target-dir` and `--force`.
